# 20 Problems, 40 Solutions: Tackling Issues the PowerShell Way

You have a problem, maybe you have multiple problems or maybe you have a problem that you aren't even aware of. Whatever you are facing, Jaap will show you how to solve this with everyone's favorite scripting language & automation tool, PowerShell!

During this session we'll look at a big variety of challenges and problems and for each we'll look at different solutions where we use PowerShell to fix the issue.

This session is meant to give you an idea of the different capabilities of PowerShell, perhaps beyond what you are using it for today, and also how you can solve a problem in different ways using PowerShell.

Jaap Brasser is a Senior Developer Advocate at Rubrik and a multi-year recipient of Microsoft Azure MVP award. He has a big passion for scripting and automation and whenever he is not writing his next script or module, he spends his time fiddling around with APIs to facilitate him in his journey to automate ALL the things!
